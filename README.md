🎯 How to Study

✅ Practice Daily — Don’t just read, write scripts
✅ Work on Real Tasks — Automate personal system tasks
✅ Use Git for All Scripts — Version control is essential
✅ Log Everything — Logging makes debugging faster
✅ Refactor — Improve readability and safety after writing

💡 Bonus Tips

Use shellcheck to lint your scripts.
Practice handling spaces, special chars in filenames.
Learn to handle YAML/JSON data (essential for Kubernetes & APIs).
Review system logs (/var/log) to learn real-world issues.
Automate health checks for your own server (good practice!).
